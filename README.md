New shuffle that learns from when songs are skipped (early, middle, late, etc.) and is more likely to play songs that are listened to for longer than songs that are skipped early.
Essentially it learns from what songs you want to listen to right now/are playing on repeat and plays those songs, and is much less likely to play songs you are skipping immediately
